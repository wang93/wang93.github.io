# Nice to meet you !

## Research Experience and Interests

I have extensive research experience in person re-id. In addition, I have conducted some surveys, demos or preliminary
experiments in face recognition, few-shot learning, CNNs compression and neural architecture search.<br>

My research interests include person re-id, few-shot learning, neural architecture search and mechanism analysis of
CNNs.
